2014-11-10  v3.6.2  disable ../ everywhere (see mailing list thread for
                    details)

                    VREF/NAME_NC -- like VREF/NAME but for new commits only.
                    Details within src/VREF/NAME_NC.

                    allow gitolite.conf to be tested locally; details within
                    contrib/utils/gitolite-local

2014-06-22  v3.6.1  experimental rc format convertor for "<= 3.3" users who
                    have already upgraded the *code* to ">= v3.4".  Program is
                    in contrib/utils.

                    giving shell access to a few users got a lot easier (see
                    comments in the rc file).

                    allow logging to syslog as well (see comments in the rc
                    file)

                    new 'motd' command

                    redis caching redone and now in core; see
                    http://gitolite.com/gitolite/cache.html

2014-05-09  v3.6    (cool stuff) the access command can now help you debug
                    your rules / understand how a specific access decision was
                    arrived at.

                    mirroring: since mirroring is asynchronous (by default
                    anyway), when a 'git push --mirror' fails, you may not
                    know it unless you look in the log file on the server.
                    Now gitolite captures the info and -- if the word 'fatal'
                    appears anywhere within it, it saves the entire output and
                    prints it to STDERR for anyone who reads or writes the
                    repo on the *master* server, until the error condition
                    clears up.

                    mirroring: allow 'nosync' slaves -- no attempt to
                    automatically push to these slaves will be made.  Instead,
                    you have to manually (or via cron, etc) trigger pushes.

                    (backward compat breakage) the old v2 syntax for
                    specifying gitweb owner and description is no longer
                    supported.

                    macros now allow strings as arguments (thanks to Jason
                    Donenfeld for the idea/problem).

                    the 'info' command can print in JSON format if asked to.

                    repo-specific hooks: now you can specify more than one,
                    and gitolite runs all of them in sequence.

                    new trigger 'expand-deny-messages' to show more details
                    when access is denied.

                    git-annex support is finally in master, yaaay!

                    new 'readme' command, modelled after 'desc'.  Apparently
                    gitweb can use a README.html file in the *bare* repo
                    directory -- who knew!

2013-10-14  v3.5.3  catch undefined groupnames (when possible)

                    mirroring: async push to slaves

                    (some portability fixes)

                    (a couple of contrib scripts - querying IPA based LDAP
                    servers for group membership, and user key management)

                    allow groups in subconf files (this *may* slow down
                    compilation in extreme cases)

                    make adding repo-specific hooks easier (see cust.mkd or
                    cust.html online for docs)

                    smart http now supports git 1.8.2 and above (which changed
                    the protocol requirements a wee bit)

2013-07-10  v3.5.2  allow ENV vars to be set from repo options, for use in
                    triggers and hooks

                    bug-fix: the new set-default-roles feature was being
                    invoked on every run of "perms" and overriding it!

2013-03-24  v3.5    (2 minor backward compat breakages)
                    1.  'DEFAULT_ROLE_PERMS' replaced by per repo
                        'default.roles' option
                    2.  'gitolite list-memberships' now requires a '-r' or a
                        '-u' flag

                    new 'gitolite owns' command (thanks to Kevin Pulo)

2013-03-05  v3.4    new rc file format makes it much easier to enable specific
                    features

2012-12-29  v3.3    bug fix: gl-perms propagation to slaves broke sometime
                    after v3.2 (so if you're only picking up tagged releases
                    you're OK)

                    the "D" command now allows rm/unlock to be totally
                    disabled

                    new trigger: update-gitweb-daemon-from-options; another
                    way to update gitweb and daemon access lists

                    new 'create' command for explicit wild repo creation, and
                    new AutoCreate trigger to control auto-creation

                    allow simple macros in conf file

2012-11-14  v3.2    major efficiency boost for large setups

                    optional support for multi-line pubkeys; see
                    src/triggers/post-compile/ssh-authkeys-split

                    bug fix for not creating gl-conf when repo para has only
                    config lines and no access rules

                    new 'bg' trigger command to put long jobs started from a
                    trigger into background

                    %GL_REPO and %GL_CREATOR now work for 'option's also

                    test suite now much more BSD friendly

2012-10-05  v3.1    (security) fix path traversal on wild repos

                    new %GL_CREATOR variable for git-config lines

                    rsync command to create and send bundles automagically

                    migrated 'who-pushed'

                    logical expressions on refexes!!!

2012-06-27  v3.04   documentation graduated and moved out of parents house :)

                    new trigger for 'repo specific umask'

                    new 'list-dangling-repos' command

                    new LOCAL_CODE rc var; allow admin specified programs to
                    override system-installed ones

                    new 'upstream' trigger-cum-command to maintain local
                    copies of external repos

                    new 'sudo' command

                    minor backward compat breakage in 'gitolite query-rc'

                    'perms' command can now create repo if needed

                    migrated 'symbolic-ref' command

                    'gitolite setup --hooks-only'

2012-05-23  v3.03   fix major bug that allowed an admin to get a shell

2012-05-20  v3.02   packaging instructions fixed up and smoke tested

                    make it easier to give some users a full shell

                    allow aliasing a repo to another name

                    simulate POST_CREATE for new normal (non-wild) repos

                    (just for kicks) a VREF that allows for voting on changes
                    to a branch

                    bug fix: smart http was not running PRE_ and POST_GIT
                    triggers

                    htpasswd migrated

2012-04-29  v3.01   mostly BSD and Solaris compat
                    also fork command added

2012-04-18  v3.0    first release to "master"
                    This is a compete rewrite of gitolite; please see
                    documentation before upgrading.
